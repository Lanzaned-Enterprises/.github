## Lanzaned?
*Hello! I am Serena or Nicole depends on what you know me by. I choose the name & logo. The reason behind it. My father. My father passed away very young from cancer. So to keep somewhat of him close to me I changed most of my game alliases, brans and logo's to things that he had drawn / created over his lifetime.*
